# Project Newlight
## What ?

Project Newlight is a brand new cryptocurrency utilizing Block Lattice Technology.  It supports distributed ledgers, mining to secure
the network, light-weight nodes, and instant transactions.  Smart contracts support is coming !

## Why ?

In response to the failure of various other Block Lattice systems to implement a sufficient system, we have addressed the short-falls
of these systems to create a fast, safe, and flexible system.

## Who ?

Project Newlight is run anonymously for many reasons.  Its ledger does not include any "pre-mined" or carved out Dev funds.

## How ?

Project Newlight has been operating in "stealth mode" for about a year, to various degrees.  Development has made progress
and a functional system should be available soon.
